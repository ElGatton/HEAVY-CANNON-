#####################               HEAVY CANNON PRIVACY POLICY


This is a free game developed by Karim Santoro. 

This app does not collect any user data or communicate any personal data to third parties. In the current state of publication and compliant with this document, the app does NOT even show advertisements although a button has been configured for study reasons.

It will give you a little starting bonus in game without open any ads or external link. So enjoy it.

I created this game just for fun, hoping that you who read these lines will enjoy my app too.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. Only one file will be stored in your device : the savegame for record and for the unlocked contents, weapons and collectibles.
This file can be deleted by uninstalling the app from your device.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

This app does not need or ask any permission or user data access to function properly. I clarify again: the only file that is stored in your device (in the dedicated android folder) will be the savegame file. More info above.


For any extra questions about this app feel free to write me an email and I will reply as soon as possible.



I really hope you enjoy my app. I wish you good things and may the wind always blow on your sails
It's time to sail mates !!! Arrrr!



Yours sincerely, 
Santoro Karim.
